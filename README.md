# What is this?
This is the web side of a two part system. This web site gives a place for an IOT device to check the status of a meeting room.  When the web status of a meeting room changes, then the meeting room's light changes also and gently reminds the current occupants, lets call them "squaters" to vacate posthaste.  This is way more effective then the traditional "stink eye" and less intimidating then peeking in and quietly asking when their million dollar sales call will be over, because I have a *very* **important** book club that needs to start now, GOSH DARN IT! ðŸ˜
